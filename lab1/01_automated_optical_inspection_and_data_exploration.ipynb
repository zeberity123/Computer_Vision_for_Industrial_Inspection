    "## Industrial Inspection ##\n",
    "**Industrial Inspection** is the process that prevents unsatisfactory or unsafe products from reaching the customer. This field has taken significant strides towards automation and efficiency. From what used to be done purely by human operators, modern inspection involves the use of dedicated machinery. Amongst the different types of inspection in practice today, **optical inspection** is the most popular. To perform optical inspection efficiently, we use systems to capture and compare images to identify defects at scale. The techniques that are used are typically rules-based and involve: \n",
    "* Template matching - compare images captured to a \"golden standard\". \n",
    "* Pattern matching - match images to both good and bad samples. \n",
    "* Statistical pattern matching - similar to pattern matching but uses several examples to accommodate minor acceptable deviations\n",
    "\n",
    "While these techniques have significantly improved the inspection process, there are some known issues related to reliability. With the improvements in **Computer Vision**, deep learning-based solutions can solve the challenges that traditional optical inspection processes face. While this workshop focuses primarily on a manufacturing use case, we believe that the development process can be adopted to a variety of industrial inspection scenarios. "

    "### Inspection in Manufacturing ###\n",
    "In the manufacturing sector, inspection is an essential function conducted during the production process to help control the quality of products. Inspection is usually done on every unit, to ensure that the quality of each product leaving the production line is high and that the items are built without manufacturing faults. In the process of product manufacturing, due to various reasons, parts and components will inevitably have a variety of defects. These defects not only affect the performance of the product but can even endanger safety. Thus, failure to perform quality assurance can pose significant operational, financial, and reputational risks. "

    "### PBCA Case Study ###\n",
    "We begin our development by discussing the problems facing **Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA)** manufacturing. For the last 50 years in the semiconductor industry, [Moore's law](https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/eri_design_proposers_day.pdf) has continued by placing more transistors in the same die area, boosting performance while lowering costs. At the same time, PCBA designs have gotten significantly more complex while also shrinking in size. This has led to the increase in cost, particularly related to production verification, for these types of products. \n",
    "<p><img alt='Figure. The Curse of Mooreâ€™s Law - Source: DARPA,  Intelligent Design of Electronic Assets (IDEA)' src=\"images/darpa_moore.jpg\" width=720></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronic components such as PCBAs, semiconductor wafers, display panels, electric batteries, and many more, use **Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)** machines as part of the manufacturing process. Automated optical inspection systems can be placed into the production line just after the soldering process. Catching problems early reduces cost as faults typically are more expensive to fix than if they are identified early in the assembly process. In addition, if the issues are systemic that relates to the manufacturing process, we need to identify them early. In this way a rapid response can ensure that problems are recognized quickly and rectified before too many products are built with the same problem. The automated optical inspection system also needs to be robust and flexible so they can be adjusted for a variety of supplier and design. \n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing an image of a board, the AOI system looks for a variety of specific defects such as imperfections in the surface of a material, soldering defects, or missing/misplaced components. When the AOI machine examines a product, it first performs an image capture of the **Region of Interest (ROI)**, followed by \"checking\" for any defects. One major issue is that the checking algorithm is usually based on traditional rule-based computer vision methodologies, which often leads to a high **false positive** rate. False positives occur when an automated solution identifies a product as defect when it is in fact not. Unfortunately, in manufacturing it is not uncommon to see high (> 10%) false positive rates, so a human operator verification is placed in the process. This is challenging since verification requires tedious manual inspection by human operators to classify false positives into true defects and adversely impact the production throughput. Furthermore, manual inspection is prone to errors as the human operators spend a very short time (i.e., < 30 seconds) per board in order to keep up with production. The problem is exacerbated when human operators experience fatigue under long, continuous working hours. As a result, true defects can be missed. This is known as **escape**, which occurs any time a true defect is missed by either the AOI machine, human inspector, or both. \n",
    "<p><img alt='Figure. Conventional PCBA Automated Optical Inspection Pipeline' src=\"images/PCBA_AOI.png\" width=720></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The defect detection process will categorize products as: \n",
    "1. OK - Non-Defective (True Negative)\n",
    "2. NG - Verified as Non-Defective by Human Operator (False Positive)\n",
    "3. NG - Verified as Defective by Human Operator (True Positive)\n",
    "4. OK - Defective/Escape (False Negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><img alt='Figure. Automated Optical Inspection Flow' src='images/Manufacturing_AOI.png' width=720></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the current process faces several challenges: \n",
    "* Tradition rules-based AOI machine produces high false positive rate, which decreases throughput and increases cost\n",
    "* Lacks flexibility to accommodate rapidly evolving parts and product designs\n",
    "* Cost of defect escape is very high\n",
    "\n",
    "Although AOI has eclipsed manual inspection in situations where complexity, throughput, or both, are high, traditional image-processing systems and algorithms have some drawbacks that are apparent in system and software development and when setting up equipment on the factory floor. To understand why automated optical inspection is difficult, consider the vast criteria that must be tested. When inspecting a PCBA, the quality of solder joints is only one criterion to inspect. The presence of each component must also be verified, as well as the position and orientation relative to the solder mask. Other criteria include component coplanarity, if the components are lifted, or if there is presence of unwanted objects such as solder spatter/ball or other contamination on the surface of the board. It is almost impossible to create rules for all cases and all exceptions. Deep learning-based solutions can be used to solve this problem. "

To build a machine learning classifier for detecting defects, we will need images for both defective and non-defective. Amongst the images we do have, the human operators manually identify true positive defects and track them within a separate file. The figure below shows an example file listing true positive components and their respective images. This file will be stored as `AOI Defect list.xlsx` for each week. We will parse this tracker and modify the `true_defect` indicator for these images.

Furthermore, an AI project is usually a multi-disciplined one, where field operations team including AOI technicians/engineers, data scientist, and AI engineers collaborate to produce meaningful results. Moreover, human operators, who are familiar with defect patterns, are needed to label and document the true defects. This also takes lots of time and patience. \n",

Data preprocessing for deep learning workloads has garnered little attention until recently, eclipsed by the tremendous computational resources required for training complex models. These pre-processing routines, often referred to as pipelines, are currently executed on the CPU using libraries such as OpenCV, Pillow. Todayâ€™s DL applications include complex, multi-stage data processing pipelines consisting of many serial operations. Relying on the CPU to handle these pipelines have become a bottleneck that limits performance and scalability. \n",

    "The **NVIDIA Data Loading Library** (DALI) is a library for data loading and pre-processing to accelerate deep learning applications. It provides a collection of highly optimized building blocks for loading and processing image, video, and audio data. DALI addresses the problem of the CPU bottleneck by offloading data preprocessing to the GPU. In addition, it offers some powerful features: \n",
    "* DALI offers data processing primitives for a variety of deep learning applications. The supported input formats include most used image file formats. \n",
    "* DALI relies on its own execution engine, built to maximize the throughput of the input pipeline. \n",
    "* It can be used as a portable drop-in replacement for built-in data loaders and data iterators in popular deep learning frameworks. \n",
    "* Features such as prefetching, parallel execution, and batch processing are handled transparently for the user. \n",
    "* Different deep learning frameworks have multiple data pre-processing implementations, resulting in challenges such as portability of training and inference workflows, and code maintainability. Data processing pipelines implemented using DALI are portable because they can easily be retargeted to TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet and PaddlePaddle.\n",
    "* Often the pre-processing routines that are used for inference are like the ones used for training, therefore implementing both using the same tools can save you some boilerplate and code repetition. "

    "###  DALI Pipeline ###\n",
    "At the core of data processing with DALI lies the concept of a data processing `pipeline`. It is composed of multiple operations connected in a directed graph and contained in an object of class `nvidia.dali.Pipeline`. This class provides functions necessary for defining, building, and running data processing pipelines. Each operator in the pipeline typically gets one or more inputs, applies some kind of data processing, and produces one or more outputs. There are special kinds of operators that donâ€™t take any inputs and produce outputs. Those special operators act like a data source â€“ _readers_, _random number generators_ and _external source_ fall into this category. \n",
    "\n",
    "DALI offers CPU and GPU implementations for a wide range of processing operators. The availability of a CPU or GPU implementation depends on the nature of the operator. Make sure to check the documentation for an [up-to-date list of supported operations](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/#operations), as it is expanded with every release. The easiest way to define a DALI pipeline is using the `pipeline_def` Python [decorator](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/). To create a pipeline, we define a function where we instantiate and connect the desired operators and return the relevant outputs. Then just decorate it with `pipeline_def`. Let's start with defining a very simple pipeline, which will have two operators. The first operator is a file reader (`fn.readers.file`) that discovers and loads files contained in a directory. The reader outputs both the contents of the files (in this case, JPGs) and the labels. The file reader can be used to infer file-label pairs from the directory structure. The second operator is an [image decoder](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/supported_ops.html#nvidia.dali.fn.decoders.image) (`fn.decoders.image`). Lastly, we return the image and label pairs. In the `simple_pipeline` function we define the operations to be performed and the flow of the computation between them. For more information about `pipeline_def` look to the [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/pipeline.html?#nvidia.dali.pipeline_def). "

DALI can not only read images from disk and batch them into tensors, it can also perform various augmentations on those images to improve deep learning training results.

These disturbances help produce models that are more robust in their predictions, avoid overfitting, and deliver better accuracy. We will use DALI to demonstrate data augmentation that we will introduce for model training, such as _cropping_, _resizing_, and _flipping_. \n",
